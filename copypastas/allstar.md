#All Star
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me<br/>
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br/>
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb<br/>
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br/>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br/>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br/>
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br/>
So much to do, so much to see<br/>
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?<br/>
You'll never know if you don't go<br/>
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play<br/>
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid<br/>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br/>
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older<br/>
But the meteor men beg to differ<br/>
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br/>
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br/>
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br/>
My world's on fire, how about yours?<br/>
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
 
Hey now, you're an All Star get your game on, go play<br/>
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid<br/>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an All Star get your game on, go play<br/>
Hey now, you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid<br/>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?<br/>
"I need to get myself away from this place"<br/>
I said "Yep, what a concept<br/>
I could use a little fuel myself<br/>
And we could all use a little change!"

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br/>
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br/>
Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br/>
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br/>
So much to do, so much to see<br/>
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?<br/>
You'll never know if you don't go<br/>
You'll never shine if you don't glow<br/>

Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play<br/>
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on, get paid<br/>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only shooting stars break the mold<br/>
And all that glitters is gold<br/>
Only shooting stars break the mold
