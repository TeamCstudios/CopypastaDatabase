# Never Gonna Give You Up

We're no strangers to love<br/>
You know the rules and so do I<br/>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br/>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long<br/>
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br/>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br/>
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br/>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Ooh give you up)<br/>
(Ooh give you up)<br/>
(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give<br/>
(give you up)<br/>
(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give<br/>
(give you up)

We've known each other for so long<br/>
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br/>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br/>
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br/>
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br/>
Never gonna give you up<br/>
Never gonna let you down<br/>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br/>
Never gonna make you cry<br/>
Never gonna say goodbye<br/>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt...
